    <p>
      Guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running on Jack
      Audio Connection Kit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guitarix takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would
      do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. The input is processed
      by a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately
      and deliver a processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the
      rack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules including
      stuff from a simple noise gate to brain-slashing modulation f/x
      like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your signal is processed with minimum latency. On any properly
      set-up Linux-system you don't have to wait more than 10ms until
      your sound is processed by guitarix.
    </p>
