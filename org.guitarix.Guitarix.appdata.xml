 <summary>A virtual guitar amplifier</summary>
 <description>
   <p>
     Guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running on Jack
     Audio Connection Kit.
   </p>
   <p>
     Guitarix takes the signal from your guitar as any real amp would
     do: as a mono-signal from your sound card. The input is processed
     by a main amp and a rack-section. Both can be routed separately
     and deliver a processed stereo-signal via Jack. You may fill the
     rack with effects from more than 25 built-in modules including
     stuff from a simple noise gate to brain-slashing modulation f/x
     like flanger, phaser or auto-wah.
   </p>
   <p>
     Your signal is processed with minimum latency. On any properly
     set-up Linux-system you don't have to wait more than 10ms until
     your sound is processed by guitarix.
